# html-source-map-rebase

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coverage percentage][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]

Rebase your HTML assets relatively to the source file they were imported from.

## Example

Consider the following Twig sources:

index.twig

``` html
<img src="./foo.png">

{% include "partials/bar.twig" %}
```

partials/bar.twig

``` html
<img src="../bar.png">
```

By rebasing the assets relatively to the file they were imported from, the resulting HTML would be:

``` html
<img src="foo.png">
<img src="bar.png">
```

## How it works

html-source-map-rebase uses the mapping provided by source maps to resolve the original file the assets where imported from. That's why it *needs* a source map to perform its magic. Any tool able to generate a source map from a source file is appropriate. Here is how one could use [twing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twing) and html-source-map-rebase together to render an HTML document and rebase its assets.

``` javascript
const {TwingEnvironment, TwingLoaderFilesystem} = require('twing');
const Readable = require('stream').Readable;
const through = require('through2');
const Rebaser = require('.');

let loader = new TwingLoaderFilesystem('src');
let twing = new TwingEnvironment(loader, {
  source_map: true
});

let html = twing.render('index.twig');
let map = twing.getSourceMap();

let rebaser = new Rebaser({
  map: map.toString()
});

let data = '';
let stream = new Readable();

stream
  .pipe(rebaser)
  .pipe(through(function (chunk, enc, cb) {
    data += chunk;

    cb();
  }))
  .on('finish', function () {
    console.log(data); // data contains the rendered HTML with rebased assets
  })
;

stream.push(html);
stream.push(null);
```

## API

`let Rebaser = require('html-source-map-rebase')`

### rebaser = new Rebaser(opts={})

Return an object transform stream `rebaser` that expects entry filenames.

Optionally pass in some opts:

* opts.map:
  
  The belonging source map in the form of a JSON string. Defaults to `null`. Note that this module basically does nothing without a source map.

## Events

In addition to the usual events emitted by node.js streams, html-source-map-rebase emits the following events:

### rebaser.on('rebase', function(file) {})

Every time an asset is rebased, this event fires with the rebased path.

## Installation

```bash
npm install html-source-map-rebase
```
